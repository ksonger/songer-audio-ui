            Unlike a typical loudspeaker driver, Songer Audio uses powerful electromagnets called field coils to produce
            a magnetic field, rather than a permanent magnet. There are some good reasons for that design decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically speaking, the tolerances of the magnetic gap and voice coil in our drivers is smaller than it is
            in a typical driver. With that in mind, the ability to remove the influence of the magnetic field during
            driver assembly is helpful for accuracy.

            More importantly however, the nature and quality of an electromagnetic field is unlike that of a permanent
            magnet, and is the better choice for sound reproduction. A permanent magnetic field has comparatively low
            permeability and is elastic, much like a trampoline. In an electromagnet however the permeability, or
            'stiffness' of the magnetic field is typically hundreds if not thousands of times higher. This means that
            when the voice coil is excited by a signal in that field, it is moved very precisely in space, and returned
            similarly precisely to a resting state. The result is incredibly accurate, low-distortion sound
            reproduction.

            Lastly, the uniform density of the magnetic field in an electromagnet is more constant as the voice coil
            moves within it, such that the voice coil draws less upon the magnetic field adversely affecting flux
            density in the gap.

            Like a select few other field coil loudspeaker producers, Songer Audio uses treated Hosho washi paper as a
            cone material, as well as for our voice coil formers. While it's subjective, we feel that the natural
            lifelike sound produced by mulberry fiber paper can't be matched.

            Unlike others, Songer Audio hand forms curvilinear cones for our drivers instead of straight cones. This
            allows for them to be remarkably thin and light, while maintaining excellent radial stiffness and
            durability, and producing sound over a very broad frequency range.

            Leather has been used as a surround materials for decades, for it's long-lasting durability and excellent
            sonic characteristics. We use the lightest and thinnest of lambskin leather for the surrounds of our
            drivers.

            Our spider assembly is a patented, highly innovative design. Composed of thermal polyurethane matrix and a
            light carbon fiber co-polyester composite collar, it holds the moving mass in light tension and further
            reduces the already feather-weight 14 gram load upon the field and voice coils. The results is music with
            extraordinary dynamics and detail.
