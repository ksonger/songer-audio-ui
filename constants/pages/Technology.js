          <p>
          The goal of the music lover is to connect with the work of artists.
          </p>
          <p>
          However, at each stage music passes through on its way from the artist to the listener, the intrusion of outside influences often
          makes that expression less true to the original work, and the listener's connection to it more remote.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our goal is to preserve that connection for music lovers, and in doing so leave behind as little of ourselves as possible.
          That guiding principle can be found in every element of each product we make.

          <p>
          A powerful 1.7 Tesla electromagnetic motor is the central driving force behind our loudspeakers. It provides a constant, highly uniform gap density.  
          It has a magnetic permeability, or stiffness, that is hundreds if not thousands of times higher than a permanent magnet.  That stiffness 
          translates into accuracy - much higher accuracy and lower distortion than permanent magnets are capable of. 
          <p>
          It is adjustable. Simply increasing or decreasing the current from our variable power supply to the field coil modifies the measurements and behavior 
          of a loudspeaker, providing the listener with freedom to tune the listening experience to his or her taste.
          </p>
          <p>
          The performance of the magnet is further enhanced by the design of our power supply. It is uniquely capable of removing overlying AC signals and 
          shunting electromagnetic back-force, which in other power supplies draws parasitically upon the electromagnetic field, causing unwanted distortion.

          <p class="subsection">Voice Coil and Cones</p>
          <p>
          To fully capture the music signal operating in that strong, precise magnetic field, the voice coil and cones must be sufficiently rigid and yet 
          vanishingly lightweight.
          </p>
          <p>
          For rigidity, our moving assembly consists of all curvilinear cones.  They excellent radial strength and maximize frequency response. The shape optimizes 
          transfer of sound into the cones from the voice coil. The depth of the cones decreases cone distortion, particularly at low frequencies. Each cone and voice 
          coil is handmade, from specially treated washi paper.  Years of development invested in cone material and treatment have resulted in an excellent combination 
          of transducer speed and damping. Rigorous refinement of cones size and curvature have minimized distortion and beaming, and enhanced off-axis performance.
          <p>
          In spite of its large 10" diameter, the entire driver moving mass, including suspension, weighs just 12.25 grams.
          </p>
          <div class="banner"></div>
          <p class="subsection">Suspension</p>
          <p>
          To transmit that potential energy with fidelity, the lightweight mass must be left completely free to accurate, linear motion. Our patented spider design is years in 
          the making, and perfectly suited to the task.  It holds the voice coil in an exacting degree of tension with a flexible, acoustically transparent lattice and
          a carbon fiber composite collar.  It places trust entirely upon the field coil and the signal of the music, offering no unnecessary resistances whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
          Paired with paper thin, reverse roll lambskin surrounds the driver is very linear, and yet achieves a remarkable free-air resonant frequency of just 17Hz.

          <p class="subsection">Cabinetry</p>
          <p>
          To complete this system, as little as possible must be interstitial between the signal of your music and the field coil. This is where the S1 
          delivers absolutely everything, again by contributing almost nothing.
          </p>
          <div class="banner"></div>
          <p>
          Speaker cabinets by their nature introduce diffraction. The S1 minimally compensates for this natural diffraction, and nothing else. It is internally
          lined, damped and well braced.  To preserve perfect phase and timing, no additional drivers are included in its design.  The signal isn't needlessly degraded, 
          as no crossover circuitry is necessary.  The S1 simply holds the driver at ear level, where it plays free of coloration, and is port tuned for deep, accurate bass response.
