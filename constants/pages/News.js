            "<p>This past Sunday, Songer Audio had the pleasure of being featured at an event for the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.meetup.com/portland-audio-club/'/>Portland Audio Club</a> and the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oregontriode.org//'/>Oregon Triode Society</a> at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.decibel-pdx.com/'>Decibel Sound and Drink</a> in Milwaukie, OR.</p><p>This was my first presentation of a complete system to a consumer audience, and it couldn't have gone any better. We had a big turnout, and it was a ton of fun. My huge thanks to the Pletkas, who invited and so graciously hosted us, and to everyone in attendance for helping to make it such a great event.</p><p>For this occasion, I showcased the S1 (this pair in a lovely African Rosewood), which were powered by JJ Electronic tube gear and drew on both digital and analog sources.  Decibel is a terrific sounding space. But it's big, too, and in the days leading up to the event I worried that the S1's wouldn't be able to fill it up. Well, I had nothing to fear. They delivered a rich, detailed, life-like sound, and deep bass response throughout the room - an amazing presentation. It was the perfect dry run for the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.pacificaudiofest.com/' />Pacific AudioFest</a>, as well.</p><p>It's a wonderful feeling watching people react to and enjoy these speakers. I've long thought that the S1 is something special, and it's encouraging that others feel the same way, too.</p>",

            "<p>It's been another very long cycle of R&D these past 6 months! I've come up for air now though, and am glad to share what I've been working on lately.</p><p>The last time I posted, I shared a 1.5-way open baffle speaker I'd developed over much of the prior year. A few months ago I decided to try one last time to come up with something even better though, before the Pacific AudioFest.</p><p>Yesterday, I finished the month-long build and had a first listen. They're now everything I had hoped for at the outset, two years ago. They are so exciting and involving to listen to, and I can't wait to play them for others.</p><p>The cabinet design and construction are quite a bit better. The folded baffle around the AE LO15 woofer is the biggest improvement - it's transformed the bass performance entirely.<p>Thanks to the suggestion of a friend, I'm applying baffle step correction differently; I've been adding a very shallow, very wide notch. It brings balance above the baffle step, but allows for a little extra brilliance and air in the last octave.</p><p>The driver design was revisited again, also. I'm calling this variation of that third iteration Type D, for dipole use. The dipole version adds a rear-firing whizzer, taking advantage of the spider assembly to produce full-range response front and back, from a single point source. The presentation is tremendous, and aside from obvious reasons to expect improvement, I think that's owed to the response being wholly phase correct - down to (and to some degree below) the low-pass cut-off on the woofer at 230Hz.</p><p>SPL is 91.6dB, a little less than I'd aimed for but not bad. Frequency response from the V3 driver is fully through the last octave now. Initial measurements yesterday taken at 1 meter show 34 - 20,000 Hz +/- 3dB, down to 25Hz measured nearfield.</p><p>The pictures are nothing special, just taken in my shop and a front foyer in the building where I took the first listen. The wood is waterfall figured bubinga. Cheers everyone, I hope you enjoy.</p>",

            "<p>We are pleased to announce that we will be partnering with the esteemed <a target='_blank' href='http://whammerdyne.net/'>Whammerdyne Heavy Industries</a> at the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.pacificaudiofest.com/'>Pacific AudioFest</a> this coming year!  I've had the pleasure of spending time recently with Whammerdyne's Pat Hickman and Matt Kamna over a couple of listening sessions, pairing our drivers and speakers with a variety of Whammerdyne's beautiful amplifiers.</p><p>I'd not' have guessed that our drivers or the S1 could sound any better than I've already heard them, but I was mistaken - listening to them sing with these 2a3 tube amplifiers is a truly special experience.</p><p>Our first session was in Pat's listening room, auditioning a pair of Onimaru drivers in open baffles.  Powered by Whammerdyne's flagship 'Ultimate Truth' amplifier, the result was a revelation.  Music was rich, room filling, utterly life-like and finely detailed - in a word, spectacular.</p><p>Our next gathering was several weeks later at Matt's.  We auditioned the S1 loudspeaker this time around, alternatingly with a Whammerdyne DGA-1, and a remarkable prototype amplifier of Matt's recent creation.  Along for the fun with us was Mr. Eddie Pletka, of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.eurotubes.com/store/pc/home.asp'>Eurotubes</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.decibel-pdx.com/'>Decibel Sound and Drink</a>.</p><p>The pairing of the S1 with Whammerdyne's amps during this session was an even more impressive performance than the last.  It was easily one of the finest listening experiences of my life, and day that I won't soon forget.  <p>The hours fly by when music is so captivating, and we all regretted when the time came to pack up and turn for home.  After hearing our S1 paired with the DGA-1, well... I just had to come home with one of my own. Thank you to Pat and Matt for their wonderful work, and hospitality!</p>",

The result will be two variants of the Onimaru - one tailored to the S1 bass reflex design, and another with T/S parameters and performance characteristics better suited to an open baffle speaker.  The first pair of this new design has already been pre-sold to a buyer - we couldn't be more delighted.<p>Over the coming weeks expect plenty of pictures, test measurements and updates as the prototype design is refined and the first production pair is produced and delivered.<p>In the meantime, here are some digital renderings of the CAD design, and a teaser image of the birch plywood prototype undergoing testing and refinement.<p>Cheers.",
