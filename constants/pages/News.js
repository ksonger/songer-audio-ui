            "<p>We are pleased to announce that we will be partnering with the esteemed <a target='_blank' href='http://whammerdyne.com/'>Whammerdyne Heavy Industries</a> at the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.pacificaudiofest.com/'>Pacific AudioFest</a> this coming year!  I've had the pleasure of spending time recently with Whammerdyne's Pat Hickman and Matt Kamna over a couple of listening sessions, pairing our drivers and speakers with a variety of Whammerdyne's beautiful amplifiers.</p><p>I'd not' have guessed that our drivers or the Enso could sound any better than I've already heard them, but I was mistaken - listening to them sing with these 2a3 tube amplifiers is a truly special experience.</p><p>Our first session was in Pat's listening room, auditioning a pair of Onimaru drivers in open baffles.  Powered by Whammerdyne's flagship 'Ultimate Truth' amplifier, the result was a revelation.  Music was rich, room filling, utterly life-like and finely detailed - in a word, spectacular.</p><p>Our next gathering was several weeks later at Matt's.  We auditioned the Enso loudspeaker this time around, alternatingly with a Whammerdyne DGA-1, and a remarkable prototype amplifier of Matt's recent creation.  Along for the fun with us was Mr. Eddie Pletka, of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.eurotubes.com/store/pc/home.asp'>Eurotubes</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.decibel-pdx.com/'>Decibel Sound and Drink</a>.</p><p>The pairing of the Enso with Whammerdyne's amps during this session was an even more impressive performance than the last.  It was easily one of the finest listening experiences of my life, and day that I won't soon forget.  <p>The hours fly by when music is so captivating, and we all regretted when the time came to pack up and turn for home.  After hearing our Enso paired with the DGA-1, well... I just had to come home with one of my own. Thank you to Pat and Matt for their wonderful work, and hospitality!</p>",

The timing of the pandemic couldn't have been more disheartening earlier this year, as lock-downs began just as the first production pairs of the Enso loudspeaker had been completed.  That's left us largely in a holding pattern for the better part of ten months, as we wait for a covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>We can't wait for the opportunity once again to share our work with others, and that's why we're so excited that, thanks to Lou Hinkley of Daedalus Audio, we have a new audio show to look forward to right here in the Pacific Northwest in the greater Seattle area.  The show runs from July 30th through August 1st.  Save the dates and attend if you can - we'd love to see you!<p>Check it out <a target='_blank' href='https://www.pacificaudiofest.com/' />here</a>.</p>",

            "<p>For the past several months, we've been hard at work here at SA working on our second product offering - an exciting new, two-way open baffle design.  For this project, the SA Onimaru field coil driver is paired with the superb, low distortion <a target='_blank' href='http://aespeakers.com/shop/lo-woofers/lo15/'>Acoustic Elegance LO15</a> woofer, covering duties from 240Hz and below for stunning, full-range sound.</p><p>Several updates have been made to the Onimaru driver over recent weeks, some to ideally suit a version of it for open baffle use.  The result will be two variants of the Onimaru - one tailored to the Enso bass reflex design, and another with T/S parameters and performance characteristics better suited to an open baffle speaker.  The first pair of this new design has already been pre-sold to a buyer - we couldn't be more delighted.<p>Over the coming weeks expect plenty of pictures, test measurements and updates as the prototype design is refined and the first production pair is produced and delivered.<p>In the meantime, here are some digital renderings of the CAD design, and a teaser image of the birch plywood prototype undergoing testing and refinement.<p>Cheers.",
